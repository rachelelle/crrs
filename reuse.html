ReUSE is a campus sustainability organization dedicated to diverting reusable items from landfills and promoting environmental responsibility. We collect reusable materials from individuals and educational departments and redistribute them back into the community. We do so in order to encourage the Cal community to take another look at their notion of waste and incorporate reuse into their daily lives in order to work towards the Zero Waste goal by 2020.
ReUSE stocks their lockers with collected materials, which are spread across the different buildings on campus. There can be all sorts of things in these lockers, from books and binders to staplers and old typewriters; we only ask of you to take only what you need and give what you can! ReUSE also holds a variety of events over the course of each semester, most notably our reader giveaway, the clothing sale, and the dorm move-outs.
We hope that through our efforts, we can make this campus a more green and sustainable place to study and to live. Thanks for visiting our page and remember to keep reusing!
