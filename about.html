At Campus Recycling and Refuse Services (CRRS) we coordinate the recycling efforts for mixed paper, beverage containers, greenwaste, wood, plastic film, inkjet/ toner cartridges, and mixed metal. We can also provide general information on waste prevention, reuse of materials, purchasing recycled-content products, and recycling other materials that we do not coordinate. CRRS also handles refuse services including garbage collection, debris box ordering, and portable toilets ordering. CRRS works with many other entities on campus to operate these programs, such as Custodial Services in the indoor collection of paper recycling bins, and Ground Services to collect greenwaste and plant debris.
