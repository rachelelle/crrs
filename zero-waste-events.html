				A Zero Waste event requires all materials generated at the event to be reused, recycled, or composted. The Zero Waste Events project, funded by The Green Initiative Fund, was created to assist all events at UC Berkeley reach zero waste. The Zero Waste Events team designed two “Best Practices” checklists, which serves as guides for planning a zero waste event.

				The first checklist is designed to guide caterers on their commitment to zero waste catering practices such as using reusable dining ware, BPI certified compostable products, or recyclable materials. The second checklist is designed to guide facility event managers on their commitment on supplying the infrastructure necessary to reuse, compost, and recycle.
